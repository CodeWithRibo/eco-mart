This web-based platform was developed to offer customers a more convenient shopping experience, reducing the hassle of visiting the physical grocery store.

The system features three main user roles: Customer, Admin, and Rider,  each with functionalities designed to support smooth and efficient operations.

Customer – The customer dashboard provides an overview of their orders. Customers can browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. The Order History section allows them to track the status of their purchases, such as Processing, Shipped, Delivered, or Cancelled.

Admin – The admin dashboard displays key business metrics, sales revenue per day, total order per month, total revenue, number of registered customers, and total number of orders. It also shows recent order activity. Admins can manage products by adding, editing, or deleting items. The system includes an Order Management module where admins can view all customer orders and assign a rider for delivery. Cancelled orders cannot be assigned to riders. Additionally, Customer Management allows admins to view each customer’s total orders, total spending, and registration date.

Rider – Once the admin assigns an order, riders can access the rider dashboard where they will see active deliveris,  order details such as product items and order ID. Riders are responsible for updating the order status, including Pending, Shipped, and Delivered. It
also see the Complemeted Today Orders, Active Orders, Total Values,
